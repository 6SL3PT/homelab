# 🏡 Homelab

## Introduction

This repository contains the configuration and documentation of my homelab environment.

The primary goal of this homelab is both educational and recreational. Lately, I’ve been exploring Kubernetes, and there’s no better way to learn than by running a cluster at home. Additionally, self-hosting applications allows me to take full ownership of the deployment and maintenance process—from start to finish.

## ⚙️ Operation System

I decided to use [Talos Linux](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos) to set up my machines. Talos is a Linux distribution purpose-built for running Kubernetes. It’s lightweight, efficient, and relatively easy to set up—especially for home lab environments—making it an ideal fit for my needs.

## 🖥️ Hardware

I use a refurbished second-hand mini pc. They're great because they are small and cheap to buy.
